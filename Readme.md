### Core Values

- Playtest from the beginning
    - Replayability is key!
    - If it wasn't tested by a real person, it's probably awful & broken.
- Always give players a few options to deal with something
- Puzzles over grinding
    - Grinding is always an option, and will be necessary sometimes. But you should be able to get the same result by puzzling instead. 
- Puzzle variety
    - Repetitiveness in stats/monsters is ok, but puzzles should always feel different with a new addition. Ex, adding a dimension rather than extending move time. Logical challenges rather than more/faster for the same puzzle. No gimicky "Get through door 1. Now get through door 2"
- Expertise is worth 1 to 2 pseudo levels
    - Grinding or puzzle luck or any kind of expertise should be equal to about that much progress (which is about 10X effectiveness)
- Never focus on profit
    - Charge enough to keep things running. Never charge players above 150% of our costs. 105% would be good to aim for.
    - Initial goal is to charge cheaply for continues and nothing else. Something cheap.
- Never cap things
    - Damage/atk/hp should be able to grow without bound, like an idle game. Use floating point numbers or similar.
