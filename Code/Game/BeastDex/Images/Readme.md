To make images, I like to go to https://boxy-svg.com/

You can copy the whole list of elements with shift-click.
You have to remove styles & then add your own.
Finally, use the image viewer page in developer options for touchups! 
Make sure the aspect ratio is square (the last two numbers in the SVG viewbox have to be the same number) or the SVG won't load correctly in the game.
